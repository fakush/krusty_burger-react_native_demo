## Development Notes

- Note: There is a lot of "cli garbagge" given by `reac-native-carousel-snap` library
  - This is a known bug of that library. As a temporary fix Comment library import and component while working on the app. Just remember to uncomment before push.

- New libraries installation
  - As a rule we recommend the installation of new libraries done by `npx expo install` command as an alternative to regular npm installation. This helps to install Expo SDK compatible libraries if found.

```sh
npx expo install [library]
```

- Also we recommend using EXPO 49 SDK Reference to search for compatible libraries and installation instructions. <https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/>

## Building for Development Testing

Follow these steps for development testing build:

```shell
npm install -g eas-cli
```

If you haven¬¥t already install EAS client and login.

```shell
eas build -p [platform*] --profile [profile*]
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to build the app for production, you can use the following Expo CLI command:

Insert API Key in app.json
 Copy the API key provided with credentials in `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` field.

> WARNING! - DO NOT PUSH API-KEY TO REPOSITORY

```shell
npm install -g eas-cli
```

If you haven¬¥t already install EAS client and login.

```shell
eas build -p [platform*]
```

*Replace [platform] with the target platform (e.g., android or ios). This will guide you through the process of building a standalone APK or IPA file.

*Replace [profile] with the target configuration profile (e.g., preview).
